# NBA Rank - crowdsourced NBA players ranking
**NBA Rank** is a website that sorts NBA players via [TrueSkill](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/)
ranking system, with data provided **only** by user votes in random head-to-head 'battles'.

So feel free to head to [nba-rank.pawelad.xyz](https://nba-rank.pawelad.xyz/) and rank 'em all!

Stats are updated daily via [NBA Stats](http://stats.nba.com/) & [nba_py](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py).

## Contributions
Feel free to use, ask, fork, star, report bugs, fix them,
suggest enhancements and point out any mistakes.

As you *may* have noticed - I'm no frontend master,
so any improvements to HTML/CSS and UX in general are more then welcome.
