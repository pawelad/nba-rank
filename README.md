# NBA Rank - crowdsourced NBA players ranking
NBA Rank sorts players via [TrueSkill](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/)
ranking system, with data provided **only** by user votes in random head-to-head 'battles' (ties accepted).
Players data is updated daily and taken directly from [NBA Stats](http://stats.nba.com/).

Soon available *somewhere*.
